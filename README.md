# Malware Detection using Machine Learning
A terminal based program which detects whether a URL or .exe file is malicious or not.

## Methodology

This project implements a terminal-based application designed to detect malicious files and URLs using machine learning techniques. Its key features are:

1. **Malware/Benign File Classification:** Utilized Random Forest classification to accurately categorize files as either malware or benign. This approach enhances detection capabilities by leveraging the ensemble learning technique for better classification performance.

2. **Feature Extraction:** Conducted detailed feature extraction from Portable Executable (PE) header files to enrich the dataset and improve the effectiveness of the classification model.

3. **URL-Based Detection:** Applied Logistic Regression to build a model for identifying potentially harmful URLs. This method improves the program's ability to detect and flag suspicious web links.

This program combines these techniques to provide a robust solution for detecting and mitigating potential security threats.
